# Project-Euler
### My Project-Euler answers that are (or not) out of the box.

### FAQ:
**Q:** Why you don't show the plain answers for us to copy and have easier work?  
**A:** Because I don't want to make people have status of good programmer if they don't deserve it. Go and try yourself.

**Q:** Why Javascript?  
**A:** Because is easy to check, easy to learn, easy to explain. If I face a problem that Javascript can not resolve, PROBABLY I will choice Java, Python or C(++ or #).

**Q:** Why not using the same language for all problems? 
**A:** I resolve these problems in my spare time. Even I knowing the algorithm to solve one big sum or calculating the factorial of 4000 (not aproximating), my time is limited and sometimes another language has an easier way to make the same thing. If you see two files of same problem, take a look because one of them is the 'hard method'.

**Q:** Are you post every problem solution? Even the 101? Even 700?  
**A:** **No.** Since Project Euler have rules, and one of these rules is "don't teach how to pass levels above 100", we are limited to that number.

**Q:** How can I pass the levels by myself?  
**A:** Deeply knowing how manipulate math, strings and array/lists of any programming language, studying mathematics a lot (some books have recreational stuff, we found some clues within it), sometimes trial and error, patience, faith.

**Q:** Any advice?  
**A:** Don't try to pass every level by brute-force. Some of them have an elegant equation or theorem behind it. Some brute-force approaches takes O(nÂ²) times, while with some algebra we can have O(1) results. Again: study!

**Q:** Can I contact you to help me with +100 levels?
**A:** **Easy answer: NO.**
